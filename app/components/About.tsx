          Hello! I&apos;m Luise Haller, a first-year electrical engineering major at Foothill College, with a growing interest in  
          robotics and quantum computing. I&apos;m particularly curious about embedded security and applications within these fields, such as quantum cryptography
          for secure communication channels and quantum key distribution for unbreakable encryption. I&apos;m excited to explore how these emerging technologies 
          can revolutionize cybersecurity and information transfer.
          </p>

          When I&apos;m not studying or working on projects, you can find me at the gym, cooking, trail running, or reading. I&apos;m always eager 
          to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects.
